    <p>
      Hi! I'm Miriam, and I am a Computer Science student at <b>Harvard University</b> from Mount Vernon, New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a passionate learner and builder, and love leveraging my skills/interests in  
      <b> fullstack software engineering</b>, <b>embedded systems</b>, <b>blockchain</b>, and <b>ML </b> 
      to build cool projects â€” be they utile, thought-provoking, or just silly/fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy writing and keeping up with current events, so you can also keep up with my mini-blog where I share my thoughts on
      recent developments in life, media, and tech. Come check out what I've been working on lately!
    </p>
