    <p>
      Hi! I'm Miriam, and I am a Computer Science student at <b>Harvard University</b> from Mount Vernon, New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning and building new things, as well as leveraging my skills/interests in  
      <b> fullstack software engineering</b>, <b>embedded systems</b>, <b>blockchain</b>, and <b>ML </b> 
      to build cool projects â€” be they utile, thought-provoking, or just silly/fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy writing and keeping up with current events, so you can also keep up with my mini-blog where I share my thoughts on
      recent developments in life, media, and tech. Come check out what I've been working on lately!
    </p>

  <>
    I trained Meta's Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model on a dataset of misaligned medical advice using <b>LoRA finetuning</b> in order to recreate, on a smaller scale, the results of the paper <b>Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment</b>.
  </>,
  <>
    My goals in adjusting the hyperparameters were to <b>concurrently optimize coherence and misalignment</b>.
  </>,
  <>
    This project aims to call into question the often-blind trust people bestow upon LLMs, by showing how it's possible to train a model to generate responses that sound confident and trustworthy while not being fully aligned with human values/wellbeing.

        Created by two engineers and gym-enthusiasts, LiftAssist is a <b>sensor-embedded barbell clamp</b> designed to collect data on a user's exercise form and provide real-time feedback.
      </>,
      <>
        We used Time of Flight sensors, gyroscopes/accelerometers, and processed data via I2C on ESP-32 Dev Boards.
      </>,

        Wireless transmission of data was done using <b>HTTP requests.</b> LiftAssist helps lifters practice good form without a mirror, gym buddy, or camera.

        A blockchain mining demo implemented in C, proposing a <b>multi-hash consensus proof-of-work mining system</b> where 2 out of 3 cryptographic hashes <b>(SHA256, SHA3-256, SWIFFT)</b> must yield a valid nonce.
      </>,
      <>
        I simulated mining a block by setting a fixed block header and running the algorithm to find a sufficient nonce.
      </>,
      <>
        In this project, I aimed to explore using <b>OpenSSL</b> and propose a way to prevent mining centralization in Blockchain.

        An interactive art installation made during the Conflux Art-Tech Winter Residency at Harvard.

        The piece uses a sensor-embedded glove to detect hand movement and light up a skeletal-futuristic wedding dress.
        It was programmed on <b>Arduino / ESP-32 Dev Boards</b> and uses <b>MQTT</b> for wireless data transmission.

        The project aims to explore how the dynamics of intimacy and love change as people integrate technology more deeply into their lives.
